# South Africa: Youth vs Adult Unemployment Analysis (2000-2024)

## 📊 Project Overview
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing two decades of unemployment trends in South Africa, revealing significant disparities between youth (15-24) and adult (25+) employment rates. This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis from raw data preparation to actionable insights.

## 🎯 Key Findings
- **2.1x Higher**: Youth unemployment (60.1%) is 2.1 times higher than adult unemployment (28.9%)
- **31.2% Gap**: Persistent 31.2 percentage point difference between age groups
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Both groups peaked during 2020 pandemic period
- **Structural Issue**: Gap persists across 24-year timeframe despite economic changes
